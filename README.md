I have tried to use the in-memory feature of EF Core

Then thought of using the Repoository pattern but later realized the test instructed to specifically use the in-memory feature of EF Core, 
so left some extra code in but commented out the rest. 

Didn't know what response code to use; so just used 200 OK for all the operations.

Tried to handle most of the errors I could.
